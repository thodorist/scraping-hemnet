# Scraping housing data from hemnet
## Hemnet is the most popular marketplace for home buyers in Sweden

* Created a daily automation in bash which scrapes all houses that are being published for sale every day.
* Property features (such as price, location, # of rooms, floor level, etc.) are being captured and transformed into .csv format.
